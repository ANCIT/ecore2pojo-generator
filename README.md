Generating POJO from Ecore Model

Motivation for the Project : 

Working on EMF Model, required POJO model for the same diagram. I had blogged a few years back about the same http://eclipseo.blogspot.de/2007/10/creating-pojos-using-emf.html?q=pojo. Tried to use it, but realised even then i dnt get rid of the dependancies on org.eclipse.emf.* plugins.

Looked online for UML to POJO Generator Plugins. Found a few but they are licensed and then found 1 from obeo which is Obeo Designer based. But found the setup to be too complicated or rather was frustrated that the simple usecase is missing.

Decided to write a small POJO Generator Plugin from an existing Ecore Model.
